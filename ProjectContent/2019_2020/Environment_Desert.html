<p>
    This Desert Environment was made completely from scratch. All Meshes, Materials, and even the Design were made by me.
    I used Blender, Substance Designer and UE4.

<h3>Substance Designer</h3>
<p>
    My favourite Materials are the Sand and the Wood. The Sand I simply like, because of the overall look and because it tiles so well.
    The Wood however, is great because it is so versatile. By layering Detail and by tweaking setting, I was able to create multiple variants very quickly.

<h3>Terrain</h3>
<p>
    The Terrain Material utilizes Tri-planar Mapping without any need for handpainting. On flat surfaces, Sand is displayed. 
    On sufaces which are a bit sloped, the sand is still displayed with decreased normals and AmbientOcclusion.
    On steep slopes, Rock is shown.<br>
    Admittedly, there is a problem. Like all tri-planar mapped meshes, my Terrain shows stretching. To hide that stretching, I placed Meshes on the affected Areas.

<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>
    My first idea was to create a Scene inspired by Dark Souls in one week. The bulk of my Reference were Screenshots from the actual games and pictures of ruins and Gothic buildings.<br>
    After I finished my first blockout - when I was sculpting the Terrain - I got the idea to place the scene in the middle of a sand storm.
    Even before I textured my Meshes, I made Materials for the Terrain. After that, I made sure to submerge parts of the scene in sand.
    When I was happy with the overall feel of the scene, I added more Materials, Details and Effects.<br>
