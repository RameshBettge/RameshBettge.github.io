    To make the 3D-Lightin effect work, you just need to place a and any number of 'Sprite Light' Blueprints into a map. That's all.<br>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
    The Sprites reference the lights on their own. Each Sprite has an instance of the LightLookupWriter class which I have written in C++.
    The LightLookupWriter writes informations about the sprite lights into a texture. Afterwards, it gives the texture to a custom Material. <br>
    For example, this is how a texture could look like if two Sprite Lights are present in the Map:
</p>
<img src="Media/2019_2020/SpriteLighting/LightLookupTex.png" class="myImg center" style="margin-left:25%; width: 30%; height: 30%">
    <br>
<p>
    Each row stores data about a Sprite Light. <br>
    - Pixel 1 & 2 store the distance from the sprite to the lamp.<br>
    - Pixel 3 stores the Light's radius.<br>
    - Pixel 4 stores the Light's color. By lowering the color's value, the Light's intensity can also be controlled.
    <br><br>
    The custom Material then processes the given data. The most important step is to calculate the dot product of the given light direction and the sprite's normals.
    The 'normals' are actually a handmade texture. The higher the red value, the further the normal points in x direction. The higher the green value, the the bigger is the normal's y value.<br>
    A value of 1 corresponds to a normal of 1.<br>
    A value of 0 corresponds to a normal of -1.<br>
    A value of 0 corresponds to a normal which faces directly forward.<br>
    The normals are transformed into world space before the dot product is calculated.
