<h3 id="Overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
    A light shines the way into another world. It reveals different versions of the same area, maybe even exposing new pathways inside walls which were solid before.
    But watch out! The ground on which you stand might dissolve into a bottomless pit as well.

    In this test version, the default world is black Nothingness. The alternative world shows white walls. 
    The green rectangles are the custom colliders which stop the light.

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
    In 2018 I created a Crystal Shader which visualizes an 'alternative World' (<a href="https://rameshbettge.github.io/Demo_Crystal.html")>Test it Right here!</a>).
    Back then, I wanted to implement a magic flashlight. Wherever it's light hits, a portal into another world should be created.
    Back in 2008 I created a prototype which I had to abandon due to the difficulty.<br>
    About a year later I wanted to tackle the same Problem again, but with a slightly different concept. Since my skills have improved a lot in that time, I was able to create
    this prototype. 
</p>

<h3>Further Plans</h3>
<p>
    The one problem I have with this prototype is, that it is utilizing a Translucent Shader.
    Because of that, I cannot use normal- and roughness-maps.
    <br>
    The solution to that problem would be to actually use post processing - just like I did for the Crystal Shader in Unity. 
    Since the new prototype was made in UE4, I would have to recreate the logic from scratch. That is why I haven't used Post Processing for this version so far. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If I decide to make a game out of the prototype, it will be a puzzle game. Different kinds of light sources can be picked up and dropped on the floor. 
    When the player places down a lantern which emits light in a cone shape, he/she has to be careful how to angle it.
    If the lantern is placed directly facing a wall, it will only create a very small portal.
    If the lantern is placed almost perpendicular to the wall however, the portal will be considerably bigger.
    This creates a lot of possibilities for different puzzles.
