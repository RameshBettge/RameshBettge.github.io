<h3 id="GameDesign">Core Gameplay</h3>
<p>
    Everything MaChick has to offer is shown in the video above. There was a lot more planned though.
    <br>
    <br>
    The core idea is, that the magical chicken called MaChick has three types of attacks: Forwards, Inwards and Backwards (lay egg).
    <br>
    She can also control three elements: Fire, Water, Earth.
    <br>
    By combining directions and elements she gets 9 different abilities, which can all interact with each other.
    <br>
    If MaChick lays a Fire Egg for example, she can make it explode by shooting fire or a rock against it.
    If she spews water on it instead, she can extinguish it safely.

<h3 id="proud">Why I'm proud of MaChick</h3>
<p>
    MaChick is the second project I ever made. 
    A lot of planning went into it, but just a tiny bit of it was actually realized.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was not a failure at all though, because I learned a lot while working on it.<br>
    To make various interactions between abilities and objects possible, I learned how to use interfaces.<br>
    A friend made custom animations and I implemented them.<br>
    The controls for MaChick feel smooth and interesting.<br>
    <br>
    Even the hit registering for the fire attack is custom made.
    The white boxes shown in the video are usually invisible and are used as triggers. If a box intersects with an object which implements my IBurnable-interface, the function 'Burn' is called.
    What this function does, is totally up to the object which was hit.

<h3 id="Shelved">Why MaChick got shelved</h3>
<p>
    MaChick was a way too ambitious project.
    Creating a minimum viable product would have been the best course of action,
    but instead I focused on story and world-building.
    <br> <br>
    I believe the scope of the game was the reason why multiple people, who had expressed their intention to work
    on MaChick, lost interest.
    <br>
    After the first prototype was done, I wasn't satisfied with the core gameplay.
    My biggest doubt was the enemies' behaviour which was way too linear.
    Back then, I didn't feel experienced enough to create something I would be satisfied with.
    <br>
    <br>
    I decided, that I'd create only simple prototypes until I'd feel confident enough
    to try something more challenging.
    <br>
    Of course I was disappointed at first, but in hindsight, I am happy that I worked on MaChick and 'failed' with it.
    <br>
    Testing my limits this early helped me understand, how good I was, and what I wanted to learn.
