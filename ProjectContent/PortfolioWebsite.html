<h1 class="proj-h1" style="text-align:center">This Website</h1>

<h3>Why list the website as a project?</h3>
<p>
    Because quite a bit of programming went into it. And because I taught myself HTML, CSS and Javascript to create it.<br>
    The only resource I used was <a href ="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_portfolio.htm" class ="link">This Template from W3Schools</a>.
    You may notice that visually, it looks almost the same as my website.
    Except for the sidebar however, it got no functionality.
    <br><br>
    All these functions were made by me for this website:
    <br><br>
    - Filtering projects by group/solo<br>
    - Resizing project panel's height<br>
    - Stopping/Starting videos on click<br>
    - Displaying a play button on videos before being played<br>
    - Loading project content dynamically (at the bottom of the page and in the sidebar)
    <br><br>
    Even though I used CSS classes from W3Schools, I also wrote around 17 of my own.<br>
    HTML was relatively intuitive and easy for me, right from the start. It being only one of three languages I had to learn, 
    made it a challenge nonetheless.
    <br><br>
    All in all, I am really proud of this website and hope it might help convince someone (you?) to give me a job in the Game Industry!
