<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Get chopped by a swinging axe, hit by a rotating hammer or crushed between walls - without even having to leave your house!
    In AR Traps the player can pull out his phone and summon deadly traps right into his own home.
    The goal is to reach the other end of the room without dying. It's a short but surprisingly exciting AR experience.

<h3 id="howWeDidIt">How we did it</h3>
<p>
    When I was looking for a team that evening I was sure, I wanted to do something new. Luckily I met someone I worked with at the VRBLN Hackathon#2.
    He had often worked with AR before, so it was his task to get the tracking and movement working. 
    For that, we used Vuforia and a technique called 'extended tracking'. 
    <br> <br>
    A piece of paper with a specific image on it is laid down on the floor and when the program recognizes it, it constructs the virtual world around it.
    It then uses the environment for orientation which makes it possible to keep the virtual world's position even when moving and when the tracker is out of view.
    <br> <br>
    My task was to design and implement all of the traps. At first, our team had difficulties deciding on a concept. Therefore I tried to make my scripts as versatile as possible.
    When we fully committed to a concept we had only a few hours left. Despite the time constraints we got at least three traps to work, each using a different script.

<p>
    My most customizable script - PendulumMovem.cs - was only used for the crushing walls. 
    To prove that it can be used in different ways, I quickly created the following example traps.
    The only thing I added is a shader to hide the blades (on the left). This way, they really can be used in AR.
