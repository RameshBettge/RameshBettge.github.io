    Two games made on two different GameJams but using the same websocket technology. 
    One PC has to start the Game and everyone can join in just by visiting the PC's IP. <br>
    No App required. Unlimited Multiplayer!
    <br><br>
    Using <a href = "https://github.com/floatinghotpot/socket.io-unity" class="link">Socket.IO</a>, 
    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/" class="link">Docker</a>, 
    a server written by my team member <a href="https://github.com/DanShu93" class="link">Daniel</a> years ago,
    and an old javascript-controller made this possible.<br>
    The controller runs on the phone and its data (ID, Vector2, and dis/connection events) is stringified with JSON and send over the server.
    It arrives at the Unity application which runs on a PC.
    This data is then destringified and processed.

    It's just like regular Snake but missing a grid, with massive multiplayer and teams.
    One team doesn't fight against the other - the opposite is the case! 
    Your true enemies are the members of your own team.
    <br>
    Ice has to avoid ice or it shatters. 
    <br>
    Fire has to avoid fire or it gets out of control and burns out.
    <br><br>
    As an ice player you can help the fire players by extinguishing their burning trails and give them space to move.
    Fire can melt ice trails which benefits the other team.
    At the end only one player per team remains. They win the game!
    <br><br>
    The websocket implementation was done by <a href="https://github.com/DanShu93" class="link">Daniel</a> and all of the gameplay by me.

<p>
    Blobby volley is a 2D game in which two players play volley ball against each other. 
    But why stop there? We wanted to create a similar game and played it with about 20 people.
    <br><br>
    This time we tried to resolve some problems we had with Multiplayer Snake.
    Players didn't know which was their character most of the time, even though each had it's own tint.
    To solve that we gave the javascript-controller a random color as a background. 
    This color was then send along other data to the game which gave the character the exact same color.
    We also added two buttons to test to give the players more advanced controls.
    <br><br>
    In the end, the game was missing multiple parts. For example, the players were intended to be able to flip their
    character upside down. This way they couldn't move as well, but they could interact better with the ball.<br>
    Flipping is possible, but it doesn't change anything except for the orientation of the hitbox.
    <br><br>
    My main task was to use the input from the websocket and use it to make the player controller. <br>
