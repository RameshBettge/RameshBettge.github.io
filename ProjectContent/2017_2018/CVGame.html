    If you are interested in me in a professional way, the CV Game is for you.
    It is meant to substitute the standard boring Curriculum Vitae with something more fun and interactive.<br><br>
</p>
<h3 id="Features">Main Features</h3>
<h5><u>Skills</u></h5>
<p>
    Hard-Skills are displayed as buttons in a list. Each skill has one 'Exp.'-bar showing my experience and amount of skill.
    A second bar, labeled 'Passion' shows how much I enjoy improving and using that skill.<br>
    Soft-Skills are in a separate list and just one bar shows how pronounced it is.
</p>
<h5><u>Education</u></h5>
<p>  
    My educational path is visualized in form of a timeline. It is very concise and can still present more in-depth information 
    when a section is clicked on.

<p>
    All features are made in a way which makes it easy to be updated and used by other people.
    One reason for this is, that an artist friend of mine plans to create art for the CV Game and use it as well.
    <br>
    The skills with all their infos can be added at one place for example, and the buttons are automatically generated.
    For the timeline, the same thing is true.
    <br><br>
    There even is a mostly functional character selection, meant to include me, my friend, and some greyed out 'unqualified' characters.
    The selection is not present in the current build, but can be tested in a seperate scene on the Github Repository.
