    <h3 id="AboutTheTeam">About the team</h3>
    <p>
        Our team consists of two programmers and two artists. 
        <br><br>
        <a class="link" href="https://www.garimann.com/">Garian Lima Simoes </a>
        was the main Game-Designer and the Level-Designer. The island with all assets on it was made by him.
        <br><br>
        Nico Prüß' main task was to design the ship and weapons. He modelled and textured them, and also created multiple smaller assets.
        <br><br>
        Celina Wuschko was responsible for the PC player's controls, the enemy behaviour and the ship's health.
        <br><br>
        My main task was to make the VR Controls work. Since I had the most experience with Game Jams and Source Control, I also acted as a coordinator.
        <br>
        All aspects of game development are interesting for me, so I influenced most aspects of our projects. The setting and part of the game-design came from me, for example.

    <h3 id="WhatIMade">What I made</h3>
    <h5><u>VR Controls</u></h5>
    <p></p>
        All the aspects of VR interaction are solely made by me. Even the input system was designed by me. 
        <br>
        The Oculus Integration from the Unity Asset Store was NOT used.
        <br><br>
        These are the essential VR interactions in Rip the Ribs:
        <br><br>
        - Grabbing <br>
        - Trowing <br>
        - Shooting <br>
        - Turning <br>
        - Moving (Teleportation) <br>
        <br>
        All interaction should feel intuitive and believable. Buckets are always gripped at the handle and pistols always point forwards, when picked up.
        <br> 
        Other objects, like enemy skulls, will keep their orientation after gripped, so immersion is not destroyed when they suddenly face in another direction.
        <br>
        Except for the Teleportation, no action feels 'gamey'. Everything feels natural, to maximize immersion.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>Sea and Bouyancy</u></h5>
    <p>
        Creating the sea was a challenge.
        <br>
        There were four steps to take:
        <br><br>
        - Creating the sea's mesh<br>
        - Creating 'waves'<br>
        - Making the boats float on top of the waves<br>
        - Rotating the boats to make everything believable.<br>
        - Moving the boats towards the players' ship and boarding it.<br>
        <br>
        What makes me the proudest is the rotation. 
        <br>
        To create the it, I sampled the sea's height at four points (front, back, left right) and calculated a rotation from it.
        <br>
        An average rotation is then calculated from the samples of the last frames.
        <br>
        The more frames are sample, the smoother the boat will be. If just a few samples are used, the boat will move more wildly and excitingly.

            <div class="overlays"><i id="bouyancy_o" class="fa fa-fw fa-play vid-play"></i></div>
            <video  
                class="video" style="width:60%; height:60%;" id="bouyancy" 
                onclick="TogglePlay('bouyancy');"  onplay="ShowPlay('bouyancy', false)" onpause="ShowPlay('bouyancy', true)" onended="ShowPlay('bouyancy', true); Reset('bouyancy')" 
                type="video/x-webm" src="Media/RtR/Bouyancy.mp4">
            </video>
        </div>
        <!-- TODO: Add bouyancy video -->
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>Destruction of Skeletons</u></h5>
    <p>
        If arms or legs of the skeletons are shot, they will detach. The bones will then be thrown into the direction of the shot.
        <br>
        Bones near to the impact will be thrown farther.
        <br><br>
        Every bone (except for hand bones, which are grouped together for performance) has a 'GrabbableObject' script, so they can be picked up.
        <br>
        To give me the ability to easily change different attributes, like Rigidbody drag, or custom torque-calculation when thrown, I created an editor script.
        <br>
        The editor script enables me to set parameters once and apply them to all bones.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>Shaders</u></h5>
    <p>
        Five shaders: GhostBody, GhostAura, teleportation, Sail, Sea

        Shaders are a very fascinating topic to me.<br>
        Luckily I found multiple reasons to work on them:

        - Ghost (Body and Aura)<br>
        - Sail (fluttering in the wind)<br>
        - Sea (color depending on height)<br>
        - Teleportation indicator<br>
        <br>
        The indicator is a cylinder consisting out of moving circles which fade out in front of geometry they hit. 
        Its color indicates if teleportation is possible.
        <br>
        Since we used the Leightweight Rendering Pipeline, I also got to try out the new Shader Graph. 
        <br>
        The sea and the sail were made with it.

    <h5><u>Resources</u></h5>
    <p>
        Our game has two resources:<br>
        <br>
        - Buckets o' water<br>
        - Puffer Fish, which are used as cannonballs.<br>
        <br>
        <!-- TODO: Remove this gameplay description as soon as a video is added. -->
        Puffer Fish occassionally jump on board.
        Buckets can be thrown on deck by the PC Player.
        <br>
        Both resources can be picked up by the VR Player and then be put in a crate at the bottom of the main mast.
        From there, they get transfered to the PC Player.
        <br>
        Puffer Fish can be shot out of the cannon to sink enemy boats.
        Buckets o' Water can be used to extinguish fires on board. 
        <br>
        Even though the controls for the PC player were written by Celina Wuschko, I implemented what happened after a bucket is thrown, the cannon is shot, or the sniper's trigger is pulled.
