<h3 id = "WhyThisWasMade">Why this was made</h3>
<p>
    The Procedural Corridor is the result of my first experimentation with the Unreal Engine.
    <br>
    In school, we learned how to generate rooms for a dungeon. 
    The one major thing missing was how to generate the corridors to connect these rooms.
    <br>
    How to generate the mesh for a corridor while only knowing where it ends and where it starts?
    To solve that, I created this project.

<h3 id="WhatILearned">What I learned</h3>
<p>
        By making just one single feature, and no gameplay, I learned a lot.
        Here are some examples:
        <br>
        <br>
        - C++ syntax<br>
        - Usage of .h and .cpp files<br>
        - Usage of Pointers<br>
        - Instantiation of Actors and Actor-Components<br>
        - Custom Editor creation<br>
        - Calling functions inside the Editor<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        These one thing I'm most proud of, is one particular skill I improved:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Problem Solving</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        On multiple occassions I got really stuck. The problem was, that all of my friends and even my teacher had almost no experience with UE4 and C++.<br>
        This meant that I had to find out about various little quirks of the Engine and Language all on my own.<br>
        It was a bit frustrating some times but in the end it really helped me advance myself.
