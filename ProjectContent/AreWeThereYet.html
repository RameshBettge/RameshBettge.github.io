<p>
    'Are we there yet?' is a game for PC and mobile made in July 2018 and polished in January 2019.
    <br>
    <br>
    You have to race across the highway to quickly reach a restroom for your children. 
    Reach the next service station, causing as few traffic accidents as possible. 
    If you fail, your carpet will be ruined!

<h3 id="HowItWorks">Car spawning</h3>
<p>
    Spawning a few dozen cars alone doesn't create performance problems.
    Nevertheless, I always strive to make my code performant.
    <br>
    In the following video you can see that cars and road-pieces are only active as long as they are needed:

    <div class="mar-top; mar-bottom"style="padding-left: 30%">
        <div class="overlays"><i id="spawning_o" class="fa fa-fw fa-play vid-play"></i></div>
        <video  
            class="video" style="width:60%; height:60%;" id="spawning" 
            onclick="TogglePlay('spawning');"  onplay="ShowPlay('spawning', false)" onpause="ShowPlay('spawning', true)" onended="ShowPlay('spawning', true); Reset('spawning')" 
            type="video/x-webm" src="Media/AWTY/AWTY_Spawning.mp4">
        </video>
    </div>

    In order to keep my ability to adjust the camera later, I made the spawn- and despawn-positions dependant on the view.
    A car will always spawn right above the top end of the screen and despawn right below it.
    <!-- To achieve this, I cast two rays from the camera and   -->
    By casting two rays from the camera, I determine where the screen ends and add a buffer to it, so the cars don't visibly plop in or out of existance.

<h3 id="Former">Development changes</h3>
<p>
    Initially, I wanted normal car controls, enabling the player to move in any direction on a 2D plane.
    <br>
    This version is still present in the repository in the scene 'OldCar'.

    <div class="mar-top; mar-bottom"style="padding-left: 30%">
        <div class="overlays"><i id="former_o" class="fa fa-fw fa-play vid-play"></i></div>
        <video  
            class="video" style="width:60%; height:60%;" id="former" 
            onclick="TogglePlay('former');"  onplay="ShowPlay('former', false)" onpause="ShowPlay('former', true)" onended="ShowPlay('former', true); Reset('former')" 
            type="video/x-webm" src="Media/AWTY/FormerPlayerCar.mp4">

    </div>

    The weird cube sticking out of the back right tire is for visualizing the rotation of the wheels.
    <br>
    When I decided the game would play on a small highway, I quickly decided that this kind of movement was just not fitting.
    It was a difficult decision, to redo almost all the controls, but restricting the player's controls much more comfortable to play.
    Now the player can just turn a limited amount to either side and when nothing is pressed, the car will align itself with the road automatically.
